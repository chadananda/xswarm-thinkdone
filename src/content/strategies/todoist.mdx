## The Case for Todoist

Here's the thing about Todoist: it's not exciting. It doesn't have a slick marketing campaign about "revolutionizing your workflow" or a cult following that treats task management like a spiritual practice. What it has is seventeen years of showing up, working reliably, and getting out of your way. In the productivity app world, that kind of track record is genuinely rare.

I've reviewed over 200 productivity tools at this point, and Todoist keeps earning its spot near the top of my recommendations — not because it does everything, but because it does its core job better than almost anything else. It's a task manager. It manages tasks. And it does it with a speed and elegance that most competitors still can't match.

But "good at its core job" isn't the whole story. After two weeks of using Todoist as my primary system (again — I revisit tools periodically because they evolve), I have thoughts. Some of them are very positive. A few are not.

## Getting Started — First Impressions

Signing up takes about 30 seconds. You get an inbox, a default project, and a quick tutorial that actually respects your intelligence. There's no 15-step onboarding wizard asking about your "productivity goals" or trying to upsell you before you've added a single task. You just start adding things.

The design is clean without being sterile. Todoist has refined its visual language over the years, and the current version strikes a good balance — enough color and hierarchy to be scannable, not so much that it feels cluttered. It's noticeably faster than most web apps in this category. Pages load instantly. Adding a task feels like writing on paper, not waiting for a database.

Within five minutes I had my projects set up, my first dozen tasks entered, and a filter for today's priorities. That's not an exaggeration — the onboarding friction is essentially zero. If you've ever bounced off a tool because the setup felt like a project in itself, Todoist is the antidote.

## Core Features That Shine

**Natural language input** is Todoist's killer feature, and I don't use that phrase lightly. Type "Review Q3 budget every Friday at 2pm p1 #Work" and it parses the task name, recurrence, time, priority, and project in one shot. After years of using this, I still find it satisfying. It removes the friction between thinking of something and capturing it, which is the entire point of a task inbox. Most competitors have added some version of this, but Todoist's parser is still the most reliable and comprehensive I've tested.

**Projects and sections** give you enough organizational structure without drowning you in hierarchy. You can nest projects one level deep, divide them into sections, and that's it. This constraint is actually a feature — it prevents the "I spent three hours organizing my task manager instead of doing work" trap that plagues tools like Notion and ClickUp. Your structure stays flat and scannable.

**Filters** are where power users fall in love. Todoist's filter syntax lets you create custom views that pull tasks across projects based on priority, due date, label, assignee, or any combination. My daily driver filter is `(today | overdue) & p1` — it shows me exactly what needs attention right now, nothing else. You can save these as favorites in the sidebar, effectively building a personalized dashboard without any of the overhead of a real dashboard tool.

**The karma system** is a small thing that works better than it should. You earn points for completing tasks and maintaining streaks, and lose them for overdue items. It's not gamification in the obnoxious sense — there are no leaderboards or badges. It's more like a gentle pulse check on whether you're keeping up. I know some people dismiss it, but I've noticed it genuinely nudges me to process my inbox on days when I'd otherwise let it slide.

**Cross-platform availability** deserves mention because Todoist takes it seriously. Native apps for iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, and Linux. Browser extensions. Email plugins. Wear OS. Apple Watch. A solid API that plays well with Zapier, IFTTT, and basically every automation tool. Whatever your setup, Todoist fits into it. The sync is fast and reliable — I've never lost a task or hit a conflict, which is more than I can say for some competitors.

## Where Todoist Falls Short

And here's where I have to be honest, because Todoist's limitations are real and they matter more as your life gets more complex.

**There's no planning intelligence.** Todoist will faithfully hold your 150 tasks across 12 projects, and it will never once ask you: "Hey, you have 23 things due today — is that realistic?" It won't suggest what to work on first. It won't notice that you've been deferring the same task for three weeks. It won't flag that your Tuesday is packed while Wednesday is empty. It's a storage system for intentions, not a thinking partner. For some people that's fine. For me, it's the single biggest gap.

**Time tracking and workload visibility are limited.** You can see what's due when, but you can't estimate how long things will take or see your total committed hours for the day. If you're trying to make realistic daily plans instead of aspirational wish lists, you'll need to pair Todoist with something else.

**Collaboration is adequate, not great.** You can share projects, assign tasks, and leave comments. But if you're comparing it to Asana's workload views, Monday's dashboards, or even Notion's database-powered team workflows, Todoist feels like it's built for individuals who occasionally share a grocery list. The Business plan improves this, but it's still not where teams with complex workflows will want to live.

**No AI-powered prioritization.** In 2025, this feels like a notable absence. Todoist added some AI features for task suggestions, but there's nothing that looks at your full picture and helps you make strategic decisions about where to focus. Your task list is exactly as smart as you make it.

## Todoist vs. The Field

**Todoist vs. Things 3:** Things is more beautiful and has a better implementation of areas and projects. But it's Apple-only and has no collaboration features. If you're in the Apple ecosystem and work solo, Things might edge out Todoist on pure experience. Everyone else, Todoist wins on versatility.

**Todoist vs. TickTick:** TickTick includes a built-in Pomodoro timer, habit tracker, and calendar view — features Todoist charges for or simply doesn't offer. TickTick is the better value on paper. But Todoist's polish, speed, and third-party integrations are stronger. It's a genuine toss-up that comes down to whether you want an all-in-one tool or a focused one with better ecosystem support.

**Todoist vs. Microsoft To Do:** To Do is free, integrates with Outlook, and is good enough for basic task management. But its filter system is primitive, it has no natural language input worth mentioning, and the design feels like it was approved by committee. If you're already deep in the Microsoft ecosystem and your needs are simple, it works. Otherwise, Todoist is a meaningful upgrade.

**Todoist vs. Notion:** This comparison comes up constantly, but they're genuinely different tools. Notion is a workspace where you can build a task manager. Todoist is a task manager, period. If you want to capture a task in under two seconds from anywhere, Todoist. If you want to build a custom project management database with linked relations and rollup properties, Notion. Most people who try to use Notion as their task manager end up spending more time configuring it than using it.

## The ThinkDone Perspective

This is where I put my cards on the table: Todoist is excellent at what it does, and what it does isn't enough for most people's actual needs.

Here's the pattern I see constantly. Someone adopts Todoist, falls in love with the capture experience, builds out their projects, and feels incredibly organized. Then three months later, they have 200 tasks across 15 projects and they're paralyzed. Not because Todoist failed — it held every task perfectly. But because having a comprehensive list of everything you need to do is not the same as knowing what to do right now.

That's the gap ThinkDone is designed to fill. Not replacing Todoist — there's no reason to rebuild the capture and cross-platform layer that Todoist already nails. Instead, ThinkDone sits on top as your strategic planning layer. It looks at your full picture, helps you build a realistic daily plan, coaches you on prioritization, and keeps you honest about what's actually achievable today versus what you're optimistically pretending you'll get to.

The ideal workflow, in my view: capture everything in Todoist because its input experience is unmatched. Then let ThinkDone help you decide what actually matters today, flag the tasks you keep avoiding, and build a plan that accounts for your energy, your calendar, and the reality that you're a human being with about six good hours of focused work in you.

Todoist is a brilliant list. ThinkDone wants to be the brain that makes sense of that list. Used together, you get both the reliable capture layer and the strategic thinking layer — which is what "productivity" actually requires.

## The Bottom Line

Todoist earns its 8.5 for doing its core job with rare consistency and polish. It's the task manager I recommend most often because it has the fewest dealbreakers and the lowest switching cost if it doesn't work out. The natural language input alone is worth trying it.

But if you've ever stared at a long Todoist list and thought "I don't even know where to start" — that feeling isn't a personal failing. It's a product gap. And it's exactly the kind of gap that a new generation of AI-powered planning tools is starting to close.
