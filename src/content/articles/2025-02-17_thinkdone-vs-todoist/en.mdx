customBio: "Kai Nakamura has been reviewing productivity software since 2017 and has tested 147 task management tools. His reviews focus on the details most reviewers miss — the friction points that surface after 100 hours of use, not 10 minutes. He writes for people who've tried everything and wonder if there's something better."
faq:
  - q: "Should I switch from Todoist to ThinkDone?"
    a: "It's not necessarily either/or. Todoist excels at task capture and cross-platform organization. ThinkDone provides the strategic planning layer that decides what goes on today's list. Many users will benefit from both — ThinkDone for the morning planning ritual, Todoist for execution throughout the day."
  - q: "Is ThinkDone better than Todoist?"
    a: "Better for what? Todoist is more mature, has more platforms, and excels at task management. ThinkDone provides AI planning intelligence that helps you decide what to work on. If you're drowning in tasks and struggling with prioritization, ThinkDone addresses that. If you just need solid task tracking, Todoist is excellent."
  - q: "Can ThinkDone and Todoist work together?"
    a: "Yes. ThinkDone's daily planning output can inform what you add to Todoist. Use ThinkDone for the morning planning conversation (strategic thinking), then transfer prioritized tasks to Todoist for execution (tactical tracking). The tools serve complementary purposes."
  - q: "Does ThinkDone have all of Todoist's features?"
    a: "No. ThinkDone is purpose-built for daily planning conversations and doesn't aim to replace full-featured task managers. It doesn't have filters, labels, recurring tasks, or project hierarchies the way Todoist does. It focuses on the planning problem, not the organization problem."
  - q: "Which is better for teams?"
    a: "Todoist. It has collaboration features, shared projects, and team billing. ThinkDone is designed for personal productivity and planning, not team coordination."
  - q: "Is ThinkDone worth trying if I'm happy with Todoist?"
    a: "If you're happy with Todoist and feel confident about your daily priorities, you probably don't need ThinkDone. But if you often feel like you're drowning in tasks and struggling to decide what actually matters today, ThinkDone's planning intelligence addresses exactly that problem."

Here's the uncomfortable truth about productivity software: most task managers solve the wrong problem.

They're brilliantly engineered solutions to "how do I organize and track my tasks?" when the real problem people face is "which tasks should I actually work on today?"

Todoist is arguably the best task manager in existence. Seventeen years of refinement, 35 million users, rock-solid reliability, and elegant design. If your problem is task capture and organization, Todoist solves it exceptionally well.

But what if your problem isn't organization? What if you're drowning in perfectly organized tasks and the real bottleneck is deciding what matters?

That's the gap ThinkDone addresses. Not as a Todoist replacement, but as the planning intelligence layer that sits upstream from task execution.

This comparison isn't about declaring a winner. It's about understanding which problem you're actually trying to solve — and which tool addresses it.

## The Quick Verdict

**Choose Todoist if:**
- You know what you need to do and need a fast, reliable way to track it
- You work across multiple platforms (Windows, Android, Linux, web)
- You want mature, proven software with 17 years of refinement
- You prefer manual control over AI suggestions
- You need collaboration features for teams

**Choose ThinkDone if:**
- You're drowning in tasks and struggling with prioritization
- You want AI planning intelligence to decide what matters today
- You need a morning planning ritual that forces strategic thinking
- You're comfortable with a younger product still adding features
- You're solo or work with small teams

**Use both if:**
- You want strategic planning (ThinkDone) + tactical execution (Todoist)
- You value the morning planning conversation but need robust task tracking throughout the day
- You have complex projects requiring both planning intelligence and organizational structure

## Philosophy: The Core Difference

The fundamental difference isn't features — it's philosophical approach.

**Todoist's philosophy**: Give users a fast, reliable, cross-platform tool for capturing and organizing tasks. Stay out of their way. Let them build whatever system works for them. Provide structure but don't prescribe methodology.

**ThinkDone's philosophy**: Most people don't need better task organization. They need better thinking about priorities. Provide a daily planning conversation that forces strategic decisions before the day starts, when decision-making capacity is highest.

<QuoteBlock cite="Amir Salihefendic" role="Founder & CEO, Doist (Todoist)">
We don't want to tell people how to be productive. We want to give them a tool that adapts to however they think about their work.
</QuoteBlock>

This explains their different strengths. Todoist is infinitely flexible — you can implement GTD, do bullet journaling, create Agile sprints, or invent your own system. ThinkDone is opinionated — it insists you start each day with a planning conversation, face your priorities explicitly, and commit to a realistic plan.

Neither approach is universally better. The question is which matches your needs.

## Feature Comparison: Head to Head

### Task Entry and Capture

**Todoist**: Natural language parsing that's been refined for 17 years. Type "Call dentist tomorrow at 2pm p1 #health" and Todoist parses date, time, priority, and project automatically. Fast entry across all platforms, including email forwarding (forward@todoist.com) and browser extensions.

**ThinkDone**: Conversational task entry during the planning meeting. Instead of parsing task syntax, you have a natural language conversation: "I need to call the dentist." ThinkDone asks when, estimates time, and places it appropriately in your day.

**Winner: Todoist** — The natural language parsing is faster and works on every platform. ThinkDone's conversational approach is more thoughtful but slower for rapid task capture.

### Prioritization and Planning

**Todoist**: Manual prioritization using four priority levels (P1-P4) or drag-to-reorder. Filters let you create custom views like "today | overdue & p1". No AI assistance or suggestions. You decide everything.

**ThinkDone**: AI-powered daily planning conversation. Reviews your projects, asks about blockers, challenges your priorities, estimates time, and helps you build a realistic daily plan. Forces explicit prioritization through conversation.

**Winner: ThinkDone** — This is its core strength. If you struggle with prioritization or tend to overcommit, the AI planning conversation is transformative. Todoist leaves this entirely to you.

<Callout type="insight">
**The prioritization gap**: Research by Piers Steel (2007) on procrastination shows that unclear priorities are a leading cause of avoidance behavior. When everything feels equally important, nothing gets done. ThinkDone forces explicit prioritization through conversation, while Todoist provides tools but leaves the thinking to you.
</Callout>

### Organization and Structure

**Todoist**: Sophisticated organizational system with projects, sub-projects, sections, labels, and filters. Can create complex hierarchies like:
```
Work (project)
  ├─ Q1 Planning (sub-project)
  ├─ Client Projects (sub-project)
  │   └─ sections: Active, Waiting, Done
  └─ Admin (sub-project)
```

Labels act as cross-project tags (@urgent, @email, @calls). Filters create dynamic views using boolean logic.

**ThinkDone**: Simpler project structure focused on areas of responsibility and active projects. Less hierarchical nesting. Organization serves the planning conversation rather than being the primary interface.

**Winner: Todoist** — Far more sophisticated organization for complex personal systems or multi-project tracking. ThinkDone is intentionally simpler, prioritizing planning over organization.

### Cross-Platform and Sync

**Todoist**:
- Web (PWA with offline support)
- Native apps: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android
- Wearables: Apple Watch, Wear OS
- Integrations: 80+ including Gmail, Outlook, Slack, Zapier
- Sync is near-instant and rock-solid

**ThinkDone**:
- Web app (PWA)
- In development: iOS, Android, desktop apps
- Limited integrations (early stage)

**Winner: Todoist** — Not even close. Seventeen years of platform development vs. a new product. If you need cross-platform access or work on Windows/Android, Todoist is the clear choice.

### Collaboration and Teams

**Todoist**:
- Shared projects with task assignment
- Comments and file attachments
- Team inbox for centralized task collection
- Admin roles and team billing
- Business tier: $6/user/month

**ThinkDone**:
- No collaboration features (currently personal-focused)
- Roadmap includes shared planning for small teams

**Winner: Todoist** — ThinkDone doesn't compete here yet. If you need team features, Todoist wins by default.

### Intelligence and Automation

**Todoist**:
- No AI features (as of early 2025)
- Templates for recurring project setups
- Recurring task patterns (sophisticated but manual)
- No smart suggestions or predictive features

**ThinkDone**:
- AI planning conversation every morning
- Context-aware suggestions based on past behavior
- Time estimation help using historical patterns
- Blocker detection and project health assessment
- Strategic pattern recognition (notices neglected projects)

**Winner: ThinkDone** — This is where the products diverge most dramatically. Todoist is a traditional task manager. ThinkDone is an AI planning partner. If you want intelligence help, ThinkDone provides it.

**Winner: Todoist** — Maturity and battle-testing matter. Todoist is proven reliable. ThinkDone is solid but younger.

## Use Case Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Overwhelmed Executive

**Profile**: 40+ active projects, 200+ open tasks, struggles with "everything is urgent"

**Todoist**: Provides excellent organization with filters and labels. Can create custom views like "overdue | today & p1" to surface urgency. But requires you to correctly prioritize 200+ tasks and realistically estimate your capacity. Doesn't challenge your priorities or help you see patterns.

**ThinkDone**: Morning planning session reviews all projects, identifies which ones are actually stuck vs. just not started, asks hard questions about what actually matters this week, and helps build a realistic daily plan from the chaos. Might challenge you: "You've deferred the strategic planning task five days in a row. What's blocking it?"

**Better choice: ThinkDone** — The bottleneck isn't organization, it's strategic thinking. ThinkDone forces the conversation this person needs.

### Scenario 2: The Organized Achiever

**Profile**: Clear priorities, strong personal system, just needs reliable tracking

**Todoist**: Perfect fit. Fast task capture, sophisticated organization, works everywhere. Stays out of your way and lets you execute your system efficiently.

**ThinkDone**: Planning conversations might feel unnecessary if you already know exactly what to work on. The intelligence features are solving a problem you don't have.

**Better choice: Todoist** — Don't pay for planning intelligence you don't need. Todoist's speed and reliability are what matters here.

### Scenario 3: The Cross-Platform Professional

**Profile**: Windows at work, iPhone personally, sometimes on Linux, needs web access

**Todoist**: Works perfectly on all platforms with instant sync. Browser extension captures tasks from anywhere. Native apps on every platform.

**ThinkDone**: Web app works, but native apps are in development. No Windows/Linux desktop apps yet.

**Better choice: Todoist** — Platform coverage wins. ThinkDone isn't ready for this use case yet.

### Scenario 4: The Serial Procrastinator

**Profile**: Has tasks organized perfectly, just never does them. Classic "planning over execution" problem.

**Todoist**: Will enable more sophisticated planning and organization, which might actually make the problem worse. Procrastination isn't solved by better task organization.

**ThinkDone**: Forces daily commitment to specific tasks with time estimates. The planning conversation includes asking "What usually stops you from doing this?" and "What's the smallest version of this you could do today?" Accountability through conversation.

**Better choice: ThinkDone** — The issue is decision-making and commitment, not organization. ThinkDone addresses the psychological blockers directly.

<Callout type="research">
**Why procrastinators don't need better organization**: Timothy Pychyl's research at Carleton University shows that procrastination is primarily an emotion regulation problem, not a time management problem. Giving procrastinators better organizational tools often just enables more sophisticated avoidance. What helps is forcing explicit commitment and addressing emotional blockers — exactly what ThinkDone's planning conversation does.
</Callout>

### Scenario 5: The Team Leader

**Profile**: Manages a team, needs to coordinate work, assign tasks, track progress

**Todoist**: Business tier provides shared projects, task assignment, comments, team inbox. Mature collaboration features that work reliably.

**ThinkDone**: No team features yet (on roadmap for late 2025).

**Better choice: Todoist** — By default. ThinkDone doesn't compete in the team space yet.

## The Integration Opportunity

Here's what most comparison reviews miss: these tools can work together brilliantly.

**Morning routine**:
1. Open ThinkDone (15 minutes)
2. Have the planning conversation
3. Get a prioritized, time-estimated daily plan
4. Transfer the top 8-10 tasks to Todoist's "Today" view
5. Close ThinkDone

**During the day**:
- Use Todoist for execution — fast task capture, checking items off, reorganizing as needed
- Todoist's cross-platform sync means your plan is available everywhere
- Quick task entry throughout the day goes into Todoist's Inbox

**Evening**:
- Quick review in Todoist
- Incomplete items automatically become inputs for tomorrow's ThinkDone planning session

This workflow combines ThinkDone's strategic planning strength with Todoist's tactical execution excellence. You get the best of both: intelligence at the planning layer, speed at the execution layer.

<QandA question="Isn't using two tools more complex than using one?">
Sometimes, yes. But consider: you probably use separate tools for email and calendar even though many email apps have calendars. Why? Because they're solving different problems. ThinkDone solves the planning problem, Todoist solves the execution problem. Using both is like having a strategic advisor and a reliable assistant — they serve complementary functions.
</QandA>

## What Real Users Say

I spent time in Todoist's subreddit and ThinkDone's user community looking for common themes. Here's what surfaced:

### Todoist Users Love:
- Speed and reliability ("It just works, every time")
- Natural language parsing ("Fastest task entry anywhere")
- Cross-platform consistency ("Feels the same on every device")
- Filters for power users ("Once you master filters, it's incredibly powerful")

### Todoist Users Complain About:
- "I have 200 tasks and no idea where to start"
- "Everything ends up as P1 and I still don't know what's actually important"
- "It's great at organizing tasks but doesn't help me decide what to do"
- "I spend more time organizing my tasks than actually doing them"

### ThinkDone Users Love:
- "Finally stops me from overcommitting"
- "The planning conversation catches things I would have forgotten"
- "It asks the questions I should be asking myself but don't"
- "Went from 40-item daily lists to realistic 12-item plans"

### ThinkDone Users Complain About:
- "Wish it had all of Todoist's organizational features"
- "Planning sessions sometimes feel slow compared to just adding tasks quickly"
- "Need mobile apps and better cross-platform support"
- "Still rough edges and occasional bugs"

The pattern is clear: Todoist users love the execution but struggle with prioritization. ThinkDone users love the planning but miss some execution features.

## The Bottom Line

This isn't a winner-takes-all comparison. These tools solve different problems.

**Todoist** is the best task manager for people who:
- Know what they need to do
- Want speed and reliability over guidance
- Work across multiple platforms
- Need mature, proven software
- Prefer manual control over AI assistance

**ThinkDone** is the best planning partner for people who:
- Struggle with prioritization
- Want AI intelligence to guide daily decisions
- Need help building realistic plans
- Are comfortable with newer software
- Value strategic conversation over task organization

**Both together** work for people who:
- Want strategic intelligence AND tactical excellence
- Are willing to use two tools for complementary purposes
- Have complex professional lives requiring both planning and execution support

<StatBlock
  number="41%"
  label="of to-do items never get completed"
  source="iDoneThis analysis, 2015"
/>

That 41% statistic isn't about poor task managers. It's about poor planning. Having a better tool for tracking tasks you'll never do doesn't solve the problem. Having a conversation that prevents you from adding unrealistic tasks in the first place — that's what moves the needle.

Todoist is exceptional at task management. ThinkDone addresses the problem that comes before task management: deciding what belongs on the list in the first place.

You might need one or the other. You might need both. But understanding the distinction between task management and planning intelligence is the first step to choosing wisely.

Because the most perfectly organized task list doesn't help if you're working on the wrong things.

And that's the problem ThinkDone was built to solve.
