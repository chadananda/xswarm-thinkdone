After fifteen years of testing task managers, he's convinced the best software is the software you stop noticing."
faq:
  - q: "Is Things 3 worth it in 2025?"
    a: "If you're in the Apple ecosystem and value craftsmanship over features, absolutely. Things 3 is the most elegant GTD implementation available. However, it's Apple-only, has no collaboration features, no AI, and no web access. It's perfect for what it is — but what it is isn't for everyone."
  - q: "Why is Things 3 so expensive compared to other task managers?"
    a: "Things 3 costs $49.99 for Mac, $19.99 for iPad, and $9.99 for iPhone — roughly $80 for the full suite. It's a one-time purchase with free updates, no subscription. You're paying for years of refinement and a sustainable business model. Whether that's expensive depends on how much you value the tool you use every day."
  - q: "Can Things 3 sync across devices?"
    a: "Yes, perfectly. Things Cloud provides instant sync across all your Apple devices. It's fast, reliable, and works seamlessly. However, it only syncs between Apple devices — there's no Windows, Android, or web access."
  - q: "Does Things 3 support GTD methodology?"
    a: "Things 3 is arguably the best GTD implementation available. Areas map to areas of responsibility, Projects support next actions, Tags serve as contexts, and the Today view with the evening check-in ritual mirrors GTD's daily review. It's GTD-inspired without being dogmatic."
  - q: "Will there be a Things 4?"
    a: "Cultured Code hasn't announced anything. Things 3 launched in 2017 after a 3-year development cycle. The company's philosophy emphasizes refinement over rapid iteration, so if Things 4 happens, expect it to be a significant reimagining rather than an incremental update."
  - q: "Can I use Things 3 for team collaboration?"
    a: "No. Things 3 is explicitly designed for personal task management. There's no sharing, no collaboration, no team features. If you need to coordinate with others, you'll need a different tool."

There's a scene in the documentary *Objectified* where industrial designer Jonathan Ive talks about Apple's design process. The memorable quote isn't about adding features — it's about saying no.

"It's actually not about doing less. It's about doing the right things. And some of those things might be extraordinarily difficult, invisible, and take years."

Things 3 is what happens when that philosophy gets applied to task management software. Not more features. Not AI integration. Not collaboration or cloud sync with every platform. Just an obsessive focus on making the core interaction — you, your tasks, and the decisions you make about them — as elegant as humanly possible.

The result is software that feels less like a tool and more like an extension of thought. The tool disappears. The work remains.

## The Philosophy: Restraint as Feature

Cultured Code, the German company behind Things, was founded in 2007 by Alex Muench and Jurgen Schweizer in Berlin. The original Things won an Apple Design Award in 2009. Things 2 refined the concept. And in 2017, after three years of development, Things 3 launched.

That development timeline tells you everything about the company's approach. Three years to ship an update. No pressure to release faster. No venture capital demanding growth metrics. Just a small team in Berlin, rebuilding their app from scratch because the previous version didn't meet their standards.

<QuoteBlock cite="Cultured Code team" role="Things 3 launch announcement">
We could have shipped Things 3 sooner. We chose not to. Every pixel, every animation, every interaction was reconsidered. This is software we expect people to use every single day for years. It has to feel right.
</QuoteBlock>

Eight years later, Things 3 remains largely unchanged from that 2017 release. Not because Cultured Code abandoned it — the app receives regular maintenance updates and iOS/macOS compatibility patches. But because they got it right the first time.

In an industry obsessed with "shipping fast and iterating," this patience feels almost countercultural. And using Things 3 in 2025, what's striking isn't what's changed. It's what hasn't needed to.

## The Design Language: When Minimalism Has Meaning

Launch Things 3 and the first thing you notice is space. Not empty space — *intentional* space. The interface breathes. Each task has room. The typography is generous. Nothing competes for attention.

This isn't minimalism for aesthetic points. It's minimalism in service of cognition. When you're looking at your tasks for the day, visual noise is cognitive load. Every unnecessary line, every competing color, every extraneous element is a micro-decision your brain has to process.

Things 3 eliminates those micro-decisions.

### The Anatomy of a Task

A task in Things contains:
- The task title
- An optional note (full Markdown support)
- An optional due date (shown as natural language: "Today", "Tomorrow", "Feb 23")
- An optional deadline (for advance warnings)
- Tags (for contexts, energy levels, etc.)
- A checklist (for multi-step tasks)
- Optional attachments and links

That's it. No priority levels (the order *is* the priority). No time estimates (you assess capacity organically). No custom fields. No status dropdowns.

The constraint is the feature. By limiting what a task can be, Things forces you to think clearly about what actually matters. If you can't express a task within these constraints, the problem isn't the tool — it's that you haven't clarified your thinking.

<Callout type="insight">
**The power of constraint**: Research by Barry Schwartz on the paradox of choice shows that more options often lead to worse decisions and lower satisfaction. Things 3's limited fields aren't a missing feature — they're a design decision that reduces decision fatigue and keeps focus on execution over organization.
</Callout>

### Areas, Projects, and Headings

Things 3 implements GTD's organizational model with elegant precision:

**Areas** represent ongoing areas of responsibility — your job, your side project, your health, your relationships. These are permanent containers that never complete.

**Projects** live within Areas (or standalone) and represent finite outcomes. "Launch product", "Plan vacation", "Renovate kitchen." Projects have a goal and a someday-done state.

**Headings** let you organize tasks within a project into sequential or parallel groups. "Pre-production", "Filming", "Post-production" for a video project, for example.

The brilliance is how this three-level hierarchy matches the way people actually think about work. Areas are your roles. Projects are your commitments. Tasks are your next actions.

You never need to explain this to users. They intuitively understand it because it maps to lived experience, not some invented productivity framework.

### The Today View: Where the Work Happens

The Today view is Things 3's command center. It shows:
- Tasks explicitly scheduled for today
- Items from your This Evening section
- Overdue items automatically rolled forward
- A subtle invitation to review Upcoming items

The evening section deserves special attention. It's a holding area for tasks you might do today if you finish the main list — or might defer to tomorrow. This single feature eliminates the anxiety of "what if I don't finish everything?"

You're not failing by deferring items from This Evening. You're making realistic adjustments to your plan as the day unfolds. The interface validates rather than judges this behavior.

<QandA question="How do I prioritize tasks in Things 3 if there are no priority levels?">
You drag them into order. The sequence is the priority. First task = most important. This forces you to actually make decisions rather than marking everything P1 and hoping for the best. It's uncomfortable at first, then liberating. You can't hide from prioritization decisions in Things 3 — which means you actually make them.
</QandA>

## What Makes Things 3 Exceptional

### 1. Performance That Feels Instant

Things 3 is built with native Apple frameworks — UIKit on iOS, AppKit on macOS. Not a web wrapper. Not Electron. Not cross-platform compromise code. Native.

The result: Things 3 is *fast*. Launch time under one second. Task creation is instant. Scrolling through thousands of tasks is buttery smooth. Animations don't stutter on older hardware.

This matters more than you'd think. An app you use ten times a day accumulating 500ms of lag per interaction is 5 seconds per day, 35 seconds per week, 30 minutes per year spent waiting. Over a decade of use, that's 5 hours of your life staring at loading spinners.

Things 3 respects your time by being instant. Always.

### 2. Keyboard Shortcuts That Make Sense

Things 3 has comprehensive keyboard support designed by people who actually use keyboards. Examples:

- `Cmd + N` new task (context-aware — creates in whatever list you're viewing)
- `Cmd + K` quick entry with type-ahead
- `Cmd + S` save and create another
- `Cmd + T` move to Today
- `Cmd + Shift + M` move to project (with type-ahead search)
- `Space` complete task
- `Cmd + '` open quick find (searches everything instantly)

The shortcuts compose logically. `Cmd + Shift` versions are typically "move to" operations. Control modifiers add secondary functions. You don't need a cheat sheet after a week of use because the patterns make sense.

Compare this to productivity apps where keyboard shortcuts feel like they were assigned randomly by an intern on their last day.

### 3. Things Cloud: Sync That Just Works

Things Cloud is Cultured Code's proprietary sync service. It syncs between Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch near-instantly.

Here's what's remarkable: it's never the subject of Reddit threads. Nobody complains about Things Cloud because it just works. In productivity software, invisible infrastructure is the highest compliment.

The limitation: Things Cloud only syncs between Apple devices. No Windows. No Android. No web interface. If you need cross-platform access, Things 3 isn't for you.

This isn't an oversight. It's a conscious choice. Building reliable sync for one platform is hard. Building it for five platforms is exponentially harder. Cultured Code chose depth over breadth.

### 4. The Apple Watch App That Actually Works

Most Apple Watch apps are afterthoughts — simplified versions that remind you why you should pull out your phone instead. Things 3's Apple Watch app is genuinely useful.

Voice entry via Siri: "Add milk to my Groceries list in Things." Works perfectly.

Quick capture with dictation when you're away from your phone. Review Today items while commuting. Check off tasks without pulling out your phone.

The watch app isn't trying to be the full Mac app. It's designed for the specific use case of being away from your primary device, and it excels at exactly that.

## What Things 3 Doesn't Do (By Design)

### No Collaboration

Things 3 has no sharing features. No team projects. No task assignment. No comments or @mentions. It's explicitly and unapologetically designed for personal task management.

For some, this is a dealbreaker. For others, it's a relief. Your task manager doesn't become a notification stream of other people's urgencies.

If you need collaboration, you need a different tool. Things 3 won't pretend to be something it's not.

### No Cross-Platform Access

Apple ecosystem only. This is the most common criticism in reviews, and it's valid. If you use Windows at work and iPhone personally, Things 3 won't work for you.

Cultured Code has never indicated plans to change this. The company's philosophy centers on crafting exceptional experiences on Apple platforms, not compromising to reach every platform.

You're either in the Apple ecosystem or you're not. Things 3 is content serving the former exceptionally rather than serving everyone adequately.

### No AI, No Automation, No Smart Features

Things 3 doesn't have:
- AI-powered prioritization
- Smart suggestions for what to work on next
- Automatic categorization
- Time tracking or analytics
- Integrations with other tools (beyond system-level share sheets)

This is philosophical. Things 3 trusts you to know what you need to do. It provides structure and organization, but the intelligence comes from you, not the software.

For users drowning in tasks who need help deciding what matters, this is a limitation. For users who know what they need to do and just need a fast, elegant way to track it, this is perfect.

### No Web Access

If you're on someone else's computer and need to check your task list, you're out of luck. Things 3 exists only as native apps on your Apple devices.

This sounds quaint in 2025, when everything is expected to be accessible from any browser. But it's also what enables Things 3's performance and offline capability. Web apps have different trade-offs. Things 3 chose native over universal access.

<Callout type="philosophy">
**The tool should disappear**: Don Knuth, computer scientist and author of *The Art of Computer Programming*, used a simple text file for his to-do list for decades. Not because he couldn't build something fancier, but because the simpler the tool, the less it distracts from the work. Things 3 is sophisticated enough to handle complexity, simple enough to vanish during use.
</Callout>

## The Pricing Model: One-Time Purchase in a Subscription World

Things 3 costs:
- **Mac**: $49.99
- **iPad**: $19.99
- **iPhone**: $9.99
- **Apple Watch**: Included with iPhone purchase

Total for the complete suite: $79.97 as a one-time purchase.

In 2025, when nearly every productivity app has moved to subscription pricing, this feels almost rebellious. Buy it once, own it forever, get updates free.

The economics work because Cultured Code is small, profitable, and not trying to hypergrow. They sell enough copies each year to sustain development and make a healthy profit. That's enough.

For users, the decision is straightforward. Is Things 3 worth $80 if you'll use it daily for the next 5-10 years? That's $8-16 per year, or $0.67-1.33 per month. Compared to subscription task managers at $5-10/month, Things 3 is dramatically cheaper over time.

The catch: there's no free tier. You can download a trial, but if you want to use Things 3, you buy it. This is a return to the old software model — you pay for software that does something valuable, and the developers make a living building it well.

## Who Should Use Things 3 in 2025

**Perfect for:**
- **Apple ecosystem devotees**: If you live in Apple's world and value native software that feels like part of the OS, Things 3 is unmatched.
- **GTD practitioners**: Things 3 is the most elegant implementation of Getting Things Done principles available. David Allen would approve.
- **People who value craft**: If you believe software can be beautiful and that beauty serves function, Things 3 will delight you daily.
- **Solo professionals**: Consultants, freelancers, writers, developers who work independently and need elegant personal task management.
- **Minimalists**: If you're tired of feature bloat and want software that does one thing exceptionally, Things 3 is designed for you.

**Not ideal for:**
- **Cross-platform users**: If you use Windows, Android, or web access, Things 3 won't work for you. Full stop.
- **Team collaborators**: If you need to share tasks, assign work, or coordinate with others, Things 3 has no features for this.
- **Analytics enthusiasts**: If you want productivity metrics, time tracking, or data about your completion patterns, Things 3 provides none of this.
- **People who need strategic guidance**: Things 3 organizes your tasks beautifully but doesn't help you decide what tasks to work on. That intelligence comes from you.

## The Verdict: Software as Craft

<StatBlock
  number="4.8/5"
  label="average rating on iOS App Store"
  source="Apple App Store, 23K+ reviews (2024)"
/>

Things 3 is increasingly rare in software: a mature product that knows exactly what it is and has no interest in becoming something else.

It won't expand to Windows. It won't add team features. It won't bolt on AI. It won't become a project management platform or a note-taking app or an email client. It will remain what it's been for 18 years: the most elegant personal task manager for people in the Apple ecosystem.

This focus is either a fatal flaw or the entire point, depending on whether you're the intended user.

For those who are — people who value craftsmanship, who want software that respects their time and intelligence, who believe the tool should disappear so the work can emerge — Things 3 is close to perfect.

The interface hasn't meaningfully changed in eight years not because Cultured Code stopped caring, but because they achieved something most software never does: they got it right.

## A Different Kind of Intelligence

Things 3 doesn't have AI, and that's worth reflecting on. In 2025, productivity software is racing to add intelligence features — smart prioritization, predictive scheduling, automated categorization.

Things 3's intelligence is different. It's the intelligence of constraint. The wisdom of saying no. The insight that the right tool is the one that gets out of your way.

If you need help deciding what to work on, Things 3 won't provide it. It trusts you to bring that intelligence to the software. For some, that's a limitation. For others, it's precisely the point.

The question isn't whether Things 3 is good software. It objectively is. The question is whether its philosophy matches yours. Do you want software that guides your decisions or software that elegantly captures the decisions you've already made?

If it's the latter, Things 3 is probably the best task manager ever built.

If it's the former — if you need that strategic planning layer, that morning conversation about what matters today and why — that's where ThinkDone comes in. Not as a replacement for Things 3, but as the planning intelligence that sits upstream from it.

The morning meeting that decides what goes on the list. The strategic layer that asks "are these the right tasks?" before Things 3 helps you execute them beautifully.

You can use both. Many people do. Things 3 for elegant execution, ThinkDone for strategic planning. One tool for the how, another for the what and why.

Because having the most elegant task manager in the world doesn't help if you're working on the wrong things. And that's a question beautiful software can't answer — but a good conversation can.
