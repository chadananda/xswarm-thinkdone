He writes to save you from discovering these things yourself."
faq:
  - q: "Is Todoist worth it in 2025?"
    a: "Yes, especially if you need rock-solid cross-platform sync, speed, and reliability. Todoist excels at task capture and organization. However, if you need AI-powered planning intelligence or strategic project management, you may outgrow it."
  - q: "What is Todoist's Karma system?"
    a: "Karma is Todoist's gamification feature that awards points for completing tasks and maintaining streaks. It includes productivity trends, daily/weekly goals, and achievement levels (Beginner to Enlightened). While some users find it motivating, others consider it superficial."
  - q: "How does Todoist's natural language parsing work?"
    a: "Type a task like 'Call dentist tomorrow at 2pm p1' and Todoist automatically extracts the due date, time, and priority. It understands relative dates (tomorrow, next Monday, in 3 days), recurring patterns (every weekday, every 2 weeks), and project assignments. It's one of the fastest task entry methods available."
  - q: "What's the difference between Todoist free and premium?"
    a: "Free includes unlimited tasks and projects (up to 5 active projects), while Premium ($4/month) adds unlimited projects, reminders, labels, filters, file uploads, comments, and productivity trends. Business ($6/user/month) adds team collaboration features."
  - q: "Can Todoist replace a full project management tool?"
    a: "For small teams and personal projects, yes. For complex team workflows with dependencies, resource management, or timeline views, dedicated project management tools like Asana, ClickUp, or Monday.com are more appropriate. Todoist excels at task management but lacks advanced project planning features."
  - q: "Does Todoist have AI features?"
    a: "As of early 2025, Todoist does not have AI-powered planning, prioritization, or task suggestions. It remains a traditional task manager focused on capture, organization, and execution — which some users prefer."

In 2007, a 21-year-old Bulgarian developer named Amir Salihefendic was studying computer science at Aarhus University in Denmark. Like most students, he had multiple projects, deadlines, and ideas competing for his attention. Unlike most students, he decided to build his own task manager.

Seventeen years later, that dorm room project has become Todoist — a task management app trusted by over 35 million people across 160 countries. It's survived the death of desktop software, the rise of mobile, the explosion of collaboration tools, and waves of venture-funded competitors promising to revolutionize productivity.

Here's what nobody's talking about: Todoist isn't still around because it revolutionized anything. It's still around because it did the opposite. While competitors chased features, pivoted strategies, and burned through funding rounds, Todoist stayed relentlessly focused on doing one thing exceptionally well — capturing and organizing tasks with zero friction.

This is the complete review. Not just what Todoist does, but why it matters, where it fits in the productivity landscape of 2025, and who should be using it versus who has outgrown it.

## The Philosophy: Tasks First, Everything Else Later

<QuoteBlock cite="Amir Salihefendic" role="Founder & CEO, Doist">
We don't want to be everything for everyone. We want to be the best at helping people capture and organize their tasks. That focus is what keeps us sustainable and independent.
</QuoteBlock>

Doist, the company behind Todoist, has stayed privately held since its founding. No venture capital. No board pressuring them to 10x their user base or add AI features before they're ready. This shows in the product — Todoist has the feel of software built for longevity, not for a Series B pitch deck.

The core philosophy is simple: reduce the friction between having a thought and capturing it as a task. Everything else — the projects, labels, filters, and integrations — exists to support that primary function.

<StatBlock
  number="35M+"
  label="active users worldwide"

That user count isn't a vanity metric. It represents 35 million people who decided Todoist is worth opening every single day. In an era where most apps see 5% weekly retention, Todoist maintains one of the highest engagement rates in productivity software.

## What Makes Todoist Different

### 1. Natural Language Parsing That Actually Works

Type "Call dentist tomorrow at 2pm p1 #health" and watch Todoist parse that into:
- Task: "Call dentist"
- Due date: tomorrow
- Time: 2:00 PM
- Priority: P1 (highest)
- Project/Label: #health

This isn't revolutionary technology — but it's implemented so well that it becomes invisible. You stop thinking about how to enter tasks and just think about the tasks themselves.

The natural language engine understands:
- **Relative dates**: tomorrow, next Monday, in 3 days, every weekday
- **Recurring patterns**: every 2 weeks, every last Friday, every! (streak mode)
- **Time specifications**: 2pm, 14:00, 2:30pm
- **Priorities**: p1, p2, p3, p4
- **Project assignments**: #project-name
- **Label assignments**: @label-name

After 17 years of refinement, the parser handles edge cases most competitors miss. "Every weekday" doesn't break on holidays if you configure them. "Every 3rd Thursday" actually works. "Starting March 1" properly delays a recurring task.

<Callout type="tip">
**Power user tip**: Combine natural language with templates. Create a task like "Write newsletter every Monday at 9am @writing" and Todoist handles the rest. The recurring task regenerates automatically, preserving the time, priority, and context.
</Callout>

### 2. Filters: The Feature Nobody Talks About

Here's what separates casual Todoist users from power users: filters.

Filters let you create custom views using Todoist's query language. Examples:

- `today | overdue`: Everything that needs attention now
- `(overdue | today) & #work`: Work tasks that are urgent
- `7 days & p1`: High-priority items due this week
- `assigned to: me & !@waiting`: My tasks that aren't blocked
- `no date & created before: -30 days`: Tasks rotting in your inbox

Filters essentially turn Todoist into a database with custom queries. You can save filters, pin them to your sidebar, and use them as your primary navigation. This is where Todoist transitions from "simple task list" to "personal task operating system."

The problem: most users never discover this feature. It's powerful but not particularly discoverable, and the query syntax has a learning curve. Once you invest the time, though, filters become indispensable.

<QandA question="Can I share filters with my team?">
Not directly, but you can share the query syntax. Copy the filter query and send it to a teammate — they paste it into their filter creation dialog and get the same view. It's clunky but workable for small teams.
</QandA>

### 3. The Karma System: Gamification Done Right (or Wrong)

Todoist's Karma system awards points for completing tasks, maintains streak tracking, and shows productivity trends over time. Complete tasks consistently and you progress through ranks: Beginner, Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert, Master, Enlightened.

The debate: does gamification help or hurt productivity?

**The case for Karma**: It provides extrinsic motivation when intrinsic motivation is low. On days when you don't feel like doing anything, the little dopamine hit of watching your Karma score increase can be enough to get started. The daily/weekly goal tracking creates accountability.

**The case against Karma**: It incentivizes volume over value. Users report optimizing for Karma points rather than important work — breaking tasks into smaller pieces to inflate their completion count, or prioritizing easy tasks over hard ones to maintain streaks. The Enlightened rank requires 50,000+ karma points and a 365-day streak, which some users find more stressful than motivating.

  pdfUrl="https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/1999_DeciRyan_PIwrtReward.pdf"
/>

My take: Karma works best when you ignore the ranking system and just use the daily/weekly goals to maintain a baseline of productivity. Set a realistic daily goal (8-12 tasks for most people), use it as a minimum viable day metric, and don't obsess over the numbers.

### 4. Cross-Platform Sync That Just Works

This sounds like table stakes in 2025, but spend time in Reddit productivity threads and you'll see how often sync breaks in competing apps. Todoist's sync is boring in the best possible way — it works instantly, handles offline edits correctly, and resolves conflicts intelligently.

Available on:
- Web (PWA that works offline)
- Windows, macOS, Linux (native apps)
- iOS, Android (native apps)
- Apple Watch, Wear OS
- Browser extensions (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Email integration (forward@todoist.com)
- Integrations: Slack, Gmail, Outlook, Zapier, IFTTT, 80+ others

The consistency across platforms is remarkable. Keyboard shortcuts work the same on Windows and Mac. The mobile apps aren't dumbed-down versions — they have feature parity with desktop. The watch apps are genuinely useful for quick capture.

### 5. Performance and Reliability

Speed matters more than most people realize. If an app takes 3 seconds to open, you'll stop using it during brief windows of free time. If sync is slow, you'll lose trust and start checking whether your task actually saved.

Todoist is *fast*. App launch is under 1 second. Task creation is instant. Sync is immediate. Over thousands of tasks and years of data, performance doesn't degrade noticeably.

The reliability is equally important. Doist publishes their uptime stats: 99.99% over the past 12 months. Compare that to competitors who've had multi-day outages or lost user data during botched migrations.

<Callout type="insight">
**The unsexy competitive advantage**: Boring infrastructure work. While competitors focused on flashy AI features, Doist spent years building rock-solid sync infrastructure and performance optimization. You don't notice these things when they work — you only notice when they don't.
</Callout>

## What Todoist Doesn't Do (And Why It Matters)

Being honest about limitations is more useful than cheerleading. Here's where Todoist falls short:

### No Strategic Planning Layer

Todoist is brilliant at managing tasks. It's not designed for strategic planning, goal cascading, or asking "are these the right tasks?"

You can create projects and sub-projects. You can organize by area of responsibility. But there's no bird's-eye view that helps you see whether you're spreading yourself too thin, whether a project has stalled, or whether your daily tasks are actually advancing your quarterly goals.

This is by design — Doist has chosen to stay focused on task management rather than expanding into project planning territory. For many users, this is perfect. For others, it means you need a second tool (or a morning planning practice) to provide strategic direction.

### No AI Assistance (Yet)

As of early 2025, Todoist doesn't have:
- AI-powered task prioritization
- Smart suggestions for what to work on next
- Natural language processing beyond date parsing
- Automatic categorization or pattern recognition
- Predictive scheduling based on your completion patterns

Some users consider this a feature, not a bug. If you want a tool that gets out of your way and lets you organize tasks your way, the absence of AI is welcome. If you're drowning in tasks and need help deciding what matters, Todoist won't provide that guidance.

<QandA question="Is Doist working on AI features?">
Amir Salihefendic has mentioned in interviews that Doist is researching AI applications, but they're taking a "wait and see" approach rather than rushing to ship AI features for marketing purposes. Given their track record, if they do add AI, it will be thoughtfully integrated rather than bolted on.
</QandA>

### Limited Team Collaboration

Todoist has team features: shared projects, task assignment, comments, file attachments. For small teams with simple needs, it works fine.

But it's not built for complex team workflows. No dependencies between tasks. No workload management. No timeline or Gantt views. No resource allocation. No custom fields for tracking task metadata.

If you need real team project management, tools like Asana, ClickUp, or Monday.com are more appropriate. Todoist's collaboration features are best suited for personal use with light team coordination, not as a primary team management platform.

### Mobile Entry Can Be Fiddly

While Todoist's mobile apps have feature parity with desktop, entering tasks on mobile is slower than you'd like. The natural language parsing works, but typing on a phone keyboard is inherently slower than desktop. The quick add widget helps, but it's still more friction than voice capture.

This matters because mobile is often where you have those "capture this before I forget" moments. Apps like Apple Reminders with Siri integration, or Google Tasks with Google Assistant, have an edge here.

## Pricing: Fair or Premium?

**Free tier**: 5 active projects, unlimited completed projects, unlimited tasks, basic filters
**Pro tier**: $4/month or $3/month billed annually
- Unlimited projects
- Reminders
- Labels and filters
- File uploads (up to 100MB per file)
- Comments and collaboration
- Productivity trends and Karma stats

**Business tier**: $6/user/month
- Everything in Pro
- Team inbox
- Admin and member roles
- Team billing

The pricing is fair by industry standards. At $3/month annually, Pro is cheaper than a streaming service and provides daily value if you actually use it. The free tier is genuinely usable for simple needs, not a cynical trial that forces you to upgrade.

The question isn't whether it's worth $3/month — it's whether Todoist's feature set matches your needs. If you need strategic planning, AI assistance, or robust team collaboration, you might not get $36/year of value even though the price is reasonable.

## Who Should Use Todoist in 2025

**Perfect for:**
- **The committed GTD practitioner**: If you understand Getting Things Done and want a tool that supports that methodology without forcing it on you, Todoist is excellent. Projects, labels, and filters map cleanly to GTD's areas of focus, projects, contexts, and perspectives.
- **Cross-platform warriors**: If you work across Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and web, Todoist's consistency across all platforms is unmatched. This is rare.
- **Keyboard shortcut devotees**: Power users who prefer keyboard navigation will appreciate Todoist's comprehensive shortcuts and speed.
- **The sustainable productivity crowd**: If you value calm software from a sustainable company over venture-backed feature bloat, Doist's philosophy aligns with yours.
- **People who want task management, not task AI**: If you know what you need to do and just need a fast, reliable place to track it, Todoist is perfect.

**Not ideal for:**
- **Strategic planners without a separate system**: If you need help deciding what to work on, not just tracking what you've decided, Todoist won't provide that layer.
- **Teams doing complex project management**: Todoist is a task manager with collaboration features, not a project management platform with task features. Know the difference.
- **People who need AI assistance**: If decision fatigue around priorities is your bottleneck, Todoist doesn't address that.
- **Visual thinkers**: If you need Kanban boards, timelines, or Gantt charts as primary views, Todoist's list-centric design won't satisfy you.

## The Verdict: 17 Years of Getting It Right

<StatBlock
  number="4.7/5"
  label="average rating across iOS, Android, and web"

Todoist has earned its reputation through consistency, not innovation. It's the task manager equivalent of a Toyota Camry — not exciting, but reliable, well-built, and still running strong after 200,000 miles.

In an industry where most productivity apps either shut down or get acquired and ruined, Todoist's independence and longevity are genuine competitive advantages. When you invest time building your productivity system around a tool, you want confidence it'll still exist in five years. Few apps in this space earn that trust.

The limitations are real. No AI planning. Limited strategic oversight. Basic team features. But these aren't failures — they're choices. Doist has chosen depth in task management over breadth in productivity features.

For millions of users, that choice is exactly right. For others, it means Todoist is the foundation of a productivity stack, not the whole stack.

## Where ThinkDone Fits

If you love Todoist's speed and reliability but find yourself wishing for strategic planning intelligence, that's the gap ThinkDone addresses. Rather than replacing your task manager, ThinkDone adds a 15-minute daily planning conversation that helps you decide what goes on today's list — and why.

Think of it as the morning planning meeting that sits upstream from Todoist. The strategic layer that answers "what should I work on?" before Todoist helps you execute on "what am I working on?"

You can use both. Many people do. Todoist for capture and organization, ThinkDone for the planning intelligence that decides what makes it to today's list.

Because having a perfect task manager doesn't help if you're working on the wrong tasks. And that's the question no task manager can answer for you — until now.
