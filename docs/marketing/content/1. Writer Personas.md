### 1. Maya Chen — The Pragmatic Optimizer

- **Background:** Former operations manager at a Series B startup. Managed 40-person teams. Tried every tool. Values what actually works over what's trendy.

- **Expertise areas:** Deep work, focus techniques, personal productivity systems, minimalism, developer tools, the philosophy of work.
- **Writing style:** "The question isn't which app has more features. The question is: does this tool help you spend your attention on what matters — or does it become another thing competing for it?"

- **Writing style:** "When you're running three businesses, you don't need a prettier to-do list. You need something that tells you which business needs attention RIGHT NOW — before the wheels come off."

### 4. Professor James Whitfield — The Systems Thinker

- **Writing style:** "I've been daily-driving [App] for 6 weeks now and I have thoughts. TL;DR: if you need [feature], this is genuinely the best option. But if you're looking for [other feature], keep reading."
- **Signature phrase:** "Here's what nobody's talking about."
