# ThinkDone Content Marketing Campaign Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan maps the entire productivity/task management landscape — every major app, methodology, keyword cluster, and user intent — and outlines a comprehensive content campaign to establish ThinkDone as the definitive voice in AI-powered daily planning.

**Core narrative:** The era of manual task management is ending. Every productivity app ever built — from paper planners to Notion databases — required YOU to do the strategic thinking. ThinkDone introduces something genuinely new: an AI strategic planning partner that thinks WITH you every morning, then hands you one clean list. The intelligence is in the planning; the interface is deliberately simple.

**Tone:** Respectful and admiring of every tool that came before. These apps solved real problems for real people. We stand on their shoulders. But the world has changed — and AI changes the equation fundamentally.

**Scale:** 380+ planned articles across 8 article types, written by 5 staff personas, targeting 600+ keyword clusters.
