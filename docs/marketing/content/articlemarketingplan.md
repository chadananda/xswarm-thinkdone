# ThinkDone Content Marketing Campaign Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan maps the entire productivity/task management landscape — every major app, methodology, keyword cluster, and user intent — and outlines a comprehensive content campaign to establish ThinkDone as the definitive voice in AI-powered daily planning.

**Core narrative:** The era of manual task management is ending. Every productivity app ever built — from paper planners to Notion databases — required YOU to do the strategic thinking. ThinkDone introduces something genuinely new: an AI strategic planning partner that thinks WITH you every morning, then hands you one clean list. The intelligence is in the planning; the interface is deliberately simple.

**Tone:** Respectful and admiring of every tool that came before. These apps solved real problems for real people. We stand on their shoulders. But the world has changed — and AI changes the equation fundamentally.

**Scale:** 380+ planned articles across 8 article types, written by 5 staff personas, targeting 600+ keyword clusters.

---

## Part 1: Staff Writer Personas

### 1. Maya Chen — The Pragmatic Optimizer

- **Background:** Former operations manager at a Series B startup. Managed 40-person teams. Tried every tool. Values what actually works over what's trendy.
- **Voice:** Direct, data-informed, slightly skeptical. Uses concrete examples from real work scenarios. Favors numbered lists and "here's what actually happened when I tried this" storytelling.
- **Expertise areas:** Team productivity tools, project management, workflow automation, operational efficiency.
- **Writing style:** "I spent three months using [App] to manage our product launch. Here's what I learned — and what I wish someone had told me on day one."
- **Signature phrase:** "Let's be honest about what works."

### 2. David Park — The Deep-Work Philosopher

- **Background:** Software engineer turned productivity writer. Deeply influenced by Cal Newport, David Allen, and Stoic philosophy. Meditates. Runs ultramarathons. Thinks most productivity advice is noise.
- **Voice:** Thoughtful, measured, occasionally contrarian. Long-form essays that connect productivity tools to deeper questions about attention, meaning, and intentional living. Doesn't rush to conclusions.
- **Expertise areas:** Deep work, focus techniques, personal productivity systems, minimalism, developer tools, the philosophy of work.
- **Writing style:** "The question isn't which app has more features. The question is: does this tool help you spend your attention on what matters — or does it become another thing competing for it?"
- **Signature phrase:** "The tool should disappear."

### 3. Rachel Torres — The Solopreneur Strategist

- **Background:** Runs three small businesses simultaneously. Former freelance designer who scaled into e-commerce and consulting. Manages everything herself with a virtual assistant. Bootstrapper. Revenue-focused.
- **Voice:** Energetic, practical, empathetic. Writes like she's texting a friend who asked for advice. Lots of "look, here's the thing" moments. Screenshots everything. Shows her actual setup.
- **Expertise areas:** Solopreneur workflows, multi-project management, client management, time-is-money calculations, bootstrapping, side hustles.
- **Writing style:** "When you're running three businesses, you don't need a prettier to-do list. You need something that tells you which business needs attention RIGHT NOW — before the wheels come off."
- **Signature phrase:** "Does it make money or cost money?"

### 4. Professor James Whitfield — The Systems Thinker

- **Background:** Retired organizational psychology professor. Published researcher on workplace productivity and cognitive load. Now consults for Fortune 500 companies on workflow design. Grandfatherly but sharp.
- **Voice:** Academic but accessible. Cites research. Explains WHY things work, not just that they do. Connects individual tools to broader patterns in human cognition. Occasionally drops a devastating one-liner.
- **Expertise areas:** GTD methodology, cognitive science, Eisenhower matrices, organizational behavior, the history of productivity, research reviews.
- **Writing style:** "Tversky and Kahneman's work on decision fatigue explains precisely why your to-do list isn't working. Every uncategorized task is a micro-decision your brain has to make before you can act."
- **Signature phrase:** "The research is clear on this."

### 5. Kai Nakamura — The Tool Tinkerer

- **Background:** Full-stack developer and self-proclaimed "productivity nerd." Has a YouTube channel with 50K subscribers where they review apps. Maintains a public Notion database of every productivity tool they've ever tested (200+). Non-binary. Gen Z perspective.
- **Voice:** Enthusiastic, detailed, fair. Loves features but respects simplicity. Provides side-by-side comparisons with actual screenshots. Never trashes an app — finds the use case where each one shines. Deeply technical when needed.
- **Expertise areas:** App reviews, feature comparisons, integrations, automation (Zapier/Make), API capabilities, cross-platform testing, UI/UX critique.
- **Writing style:** "I've been daily-driving [App] for 6 weeks now and I have thoughts. TL;DR: if you need [feature], this is genuinely the best option. But if you're looking for [other feature], keep reading."
- **Signature phrase:** "Here's what nobody's talking about."

## Part 3: Product Deep-Dive Articles

### Tier 1 — Major Players (highest search volume, write first)

| # | Product | Author | Angle | Key Keywords |
|---|---------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Todoist** | Kai | The gold standard of simple task management. Founded by Amir Salihefendic in 2007. Grew to 30M+ users. Natural language input was revolutionary. Karma system gamified productivity. But it always left the THINKING to you. | todoist review, todoist pros cons, todoist alternatives |
| 2 | **Things 3** | David | A love letter to software craftsmanship. Cultbytes GmbH's masterpiece. The most beautiful task manager ever designed. Headings, areas, projects — elegant GTD implementation. Apple-only, and proud of it. But beauty doesn't plan your day. | things 3 review, things app, best mac todo app |
| 3 | **Asana** | Maya | Built by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and Justin Rosenstein (who also built the Facebook Like button). The enterprise planning powerhouse. Timeline view, workload management, portfolios. Brilliant for teams — overwhelming for individuals. | asana review, asana for personal use, asana alternatives |
| 4 | **Trello** | Rachel | Joel Spolsky and Michael Pryor's visual revolution. Born at Fog Creek Software in 2011. Kanban boards that anyone could understand. 50M+ users. Acquired by Atlassian for $425M. Changed how the world visualizes work — but boards don't think for you. | trello review, trello alternatives, trello vs |
| 5 | **Notion** | Kai | Ivan Zhao's all-in-one workspace. Near-death experience in 2015, then explosive growth. Databases, wikis, docs, tasks — infinitely flexible. The LEGO set of productivity. But infinite flexibility is both its superpower and its trap. | notion review, notion for tasks, notion alternatives |
| 6 | **Monday.com** | Maya | Roy Mann and Eran Zinman's colorful work OS. $6.8B IPO. Gorgeous dashboards. The "make work feel fun" approach. Enterprise-grade with consumer-friendly UI. But dashboards about work aren't the same as doing work. | monday.com review, monday alternatives |
| 7 | **ClickUp** | Kai | Zeb Evans' "one app to replace them all." Fastest-growing project management tool in history. Feature density that makes competitors blush. Everything including docs, whiteboards, chat. The kitchen sink approach — impressive but exhausting. | clickup review, clickup vs asana, clickup alternatives |
| 8 | **Microsoft To Do** | David | The spiritual successor to Wunderlist (after Microsoft acquired and sunset it). Christian Reber's baby, reborn in Microsoft's ecosystem. My Day feature was genuinely innovative — a daily focus list. Deep Microsoft 365 integration. | microsoft to do review, wunderlist replacement |
| 9 | **Google Tasks** | Rachel | Google's perennial afterthought that millions use anyway. Tight Gmail and Calendar integration. Almost aggressively simple. The "it's already there" productivity tool. No frills, no strategy, no intelligence. | google tasks review, google tasks vs todoist |
| 10 | **OmniFocus** | Professor | The Omni Group's GTD power tool. Ken Case's brainchild. The most faithful digital implementation of David Allen's methodology. Perspectives, review mode, defer dates. Beloved by GTD purists — impenetrable to everyone else. | omnifocus review, omnifocus vs things, best gtd app |
| 11 | **Jira** | Maya | Atlassian's issue tracker that ate the software world. Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar built it in 2002. Sprints, epics, story points — the language of agile. Essential for dev teams. Accidentally became a task manager for non-devs too (and suffered for it). | jira review, jira for personal use, jira alternatives |
| 12 | **Basecamp** | David | Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson's opinionated masterpiece. "Shape Up" methodology. Hill charts. Flat monthly pricing. The anti-enterprise project tool. Deliberately constrained — and that was the point. | basecamp review, basecamp vs asana, basecamp alternatives |

### Tier 2 — Strong Contenders (solid search volume)

| # | Product | Author | Angle |
|---|---------|--------|-------|
| 13 | **Wunderlist** | Kai | Christian Reber's beloved app. 13M users. Acquired by Microsoft in 2015. Shut down in 2020. The app people STILL miss. A cautionary tale about acquisition. Reber publicly tried to buy it back. |
| 14 | **TickTick** | Kai | The underdog from China. Appest Limited built it. Pomodoro timer built in. Calendar view. Habit tracker. The most feature-complete "simple" task app. Flew under the radar while delivering everything. |
| 15 | **Any.do** | Rachel | Omer Perchik's Israeli startup. Beautiful onboarding. "Plan My Day" feature was ahead of its time. Voice entry. Cal (calendar app) integration. Tried to be the AI planner before AI was ready. |
| 16 | **Remember The Milk** | Professor | Omar and Emily Boyd's pioneering web app from 2005. One of the first cloud-based task managers. Smart lists. Locations-based reminders before smartphones. A true original. |
| 17 | **Toodledo** | Professor | Jake Olefsky's ultra-customizable task manager from 2006. Folders, contexts, goals, custom fields. The spreadsheet lover's todo app. Powerful but visually dated. |
| 18 | **Apple Reminders** | David | The default that improved dramatically. iOS 13 revamp made it genuinely useful. Smart lists, tags, collaboration. The "good enough" option for Apple users. Free, built-in, and increasingly capable. |
| 19 | **Google Keep** | Rachel | Google's sticky note app. Not a task manager, but millions used it as one. Color coding, labels, reminders. The post-it note for the digital age. |
| 20 | **Evernote** | Maya | Stepan Pachikov and Phil Libin's note-taking giant. 200M+ users at peak. Web clipping, OCR, notebooks. Tried to be a workspace, struggled with identity. The cautionary tale of feature bloat. |
| 21 | **Habitica** | Kai | Tyler Renelle's gamified task manager. RPG mechanics for productivity. Earn gold, buy gear, fight monsters — by completing tasks. Brilliant concept that works surprisingly well for certain personality types. |
| 22 | **Forest** | David | The anti-phone app. Plant virtual trees by not touching your phone. Partnered with Trees for the Future to plant real trees. Focus through simplicity and guilt. |
| 23 | **Sunsama** | David | Ashutosh Priyadarshy's daily planner. Timeboxing philosophy. Pull tasks from other tools. The "daily planning ritual" approach — closest philosophy to ThinkDone, but without AI intelligence. |
| 24 | **Reclaim.ai** | Maya | Henry Shapiro and Patrick Lightbody's AI scheduling tool. Auto-schedules tasks into calendar gaps. Habit scheduling. Meeting optimization. Smart but calendar-first, not strategy-first. |
| 25 | **Motion** | Maya | AI auto-scheduling. Built by ex-Googlers. Automatically plans your day around meetings. $34/mo. Bold pricing for a bold promise. Calendar-centric approach. |
| 26 | **Linear** | Kai | Karri Saarinen and Tuomas Artman's developer issue tracker. Breathtakingly fast UI. Keyboard-first design. The anti-Jira. Beautiful, opinionated, developer-focused. |
| 27 | **Airtable** | Rachel | Howie Liu's spreadsheet-database hybrid. $11B valuation. Infinitely flexible relational data. Used as a task manager by creative teams. The power-user's canvas. |
| 28 | **Smartsheet** | Maya | Enterprise work management. Mark Mader's spreadsheet-inspired platform. $8B acquisition by Blackstone. Gantt charts, dashboards, automations. The corporate planning tool. |
| 29 | **Wrike** | Maya | Andrew Filev's project management platform. Founded in 2006. Real-time editing, Gantt charts, cross-tagging. Enterprise-grade with good UX. |

## Part 5: Methodology & Technique Articles

### Core Methodologies

| # | Article Title | Author | Focus |
|---|--------------|--------|-------|
| M1 | **The Complete Guide to Getting Things Done (GTD)** | Professor | David Allen's 5-step system. History, principles, implementation. Why it works. How AI enhances capture, clarify, organize, reflect, engage. ThinkDone as the AI-powered weekly review. |
| M2 | **GTD in the AI Age: What David Allen Got Right (and What's Changed)** | Professor | GTD was designed for a pre-AI world. The principles endure but the implementation changes fundamentally when AI can do the "clarify" and "organize" steps for you. |
| M3 | **The Pomodoro Technique: Complete Guide** | David | Francesco Cirillo's 25-minute focus method. History (1987, a tomato timer). When it works, when it doesn't. Tools. Combining with ThinkDone's daily list. |
| M4 | **The Eisenhower Matrix: Urgent vs Important** | Professor | Dwight Eisenhower's prioritization framework. How to actually use it (most people get it wrong). Why AI can categorize better than you can. |
| M5 | **Bullet Journaling: The Analog System That Inspired a Movement** | David | Ryder Carroll's invention. The migration system as analog review. Index, collections, rapid logging. Why millions went back to paper — and what that says about digital tools. |
| M6 | **Kanban for Personal Productivity** | Maya | Toyota's production system applied to personal work. WIP limits. The power of visualization. When boards help and when they become clutter. |
| M7 | **Time Blocking: Cal Newport's Secret Weapon** | David | Deep Work meets the calendar. Every minute has a job. How to implement it. When it works (focused creative work) and when it fails (reactive roles). |
| M8 | **Eat the Frog: Tackling Your Hardest Task First** | Rachel | Brian Tracy's method. The psychology of momentum. Counterpoint: ThinkDone's "quick wins first" approach and why building momentum beats willpower. |
| M9 | **The Ivy Lee Method: The Original Productivity Hack** | Professor | 1918. Charles Schwab. Six tasks. $25,000. The simplest system ever devised — and ThinkDone's direct ancestor. |
| M10 | **Zen to Done (ZTD): Leo Babauta's GTD Alternative** | David | Simpler than GTD. 10 habits. Minimalist approach. For people who found GTD overwhelming. |
| M11 | **The PARA Method: Tiago Forte's Organizational System** | Kai | Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives. Building a Second Brain. How to organize everything. The knowledge management approach to productivity. |
| M12 | **Autofocus & Final Version: Mark Forster's Systems** | Professor | The maverick productivity thinker. Scanning lists until something "stands out." Intuition-based prioritization. Radical and underappreciated. |
| M13 | **The 1-3-5 Rule: A Simple Daily Framework** | Rachel | 1 big thing, 3 medium things, 5 small things. Simple, elegant, realistic. How ThinkDone automates this with AI. |
| M14 | **Warren Buffett's 2-List Strategy** | Rachel | 25 goals, circle 5, avoid the rest. Focus is about saying no. Applied to daily planning. |

## Part 8: Thought Leadership Essays

| # | Title | Author | Angle |
|---|-------|--------|-------|
| T1 | **The Productivity App Is Dead. Long Live the Planning Partner.** | David | Thesis: every productivity app from 1987-2023 shared one fatal assumption — that you should do the strategic thinking. AI breaks this assumption entirely. |
| T2 | **Why the Smartest Productivity Tool Is the Simplest Interface** | David | Complexity belongs in the planning, not the UI. The case for radical interface simplicity. |
| T3 | **Done Is the Engine of More: A Manifesto** | Rachel | ThinkDone's philosophy as a productivity worldview. Completion momentum. The psychology of checking things off. |

| T5 | **What David Allen Got Right (And What AI Completes)** | Professor | GTD's enduring principles + AI's ability to automate the hardest parts (clarify, organize, reflect). |
| T6 | **The Morning Meeting: Reclaiming the First 15 Minutes** | David | How the first 15 minutes of your day determine the other 960. The science of morning routines. The case for strategic (not reactive) mornings. |
| T7 | **Why Your Best Tool Doesn't Have a Feature List** | David | Anti-feature-war essay. The app that wins isn't the one with the most features — it's the one that requires the least of you. |
| T8 | **The Productivity Industry's Dirty Secret** | Professor | The productivity-industrial complex profits from you NEVER being productive enough. ThinkDone's different incentive: you should spend LESS time in the app, not more. |
| T9 | **From Task Manager to Thought Partner: The Next Era of Productivity** | Professor | The evolution: paper → digital lists → project management → AI planning. What comes next. |

---

## Part 11: CTA Strategy

### CTA Placement Rules

Every article includes ThinkDone CTAs in these positions:

1. **Top banner** (sticky, subtle): "Tired of planning manually? ThinkDone's AI plans your day in 15 minutes. Try it for a buck."
2. **Mid-article contextual CTA**: Inserted naturally after discussing a limitation that ThinkDone solves. Written in the author's voice, not as an ad.
3. **Bottom CTA card**: Full-width card with headline, 1-sentence pitch, and button.
4. **Sidebar widget** (on desktop): "See how ThinkDone compares" with link to relevant comparison article.

### CTA Copy Variations (rotate)

| Variant | Headline | Button |
|---------|----------|--------|
| A | "What if your todo app planned your day for you?" | "Try It for a Buck" |
| B | "15 minutes every morning. One clean list. Done." | "See How It Works" |
| C | "Your AI chief of staff is waiting." | "Start Your $1 Trial" |
| D | "Stop managing tasks. Start finishing them." | "Try ThinkDone for $1" |
| E | "Every app on this list asks you to plan. ThinkDone plans for you." | "Try It for a Buck" |

### CTA Context Rules

- **Product deep-dives:** CTA positioned after the "Limitations" section. Frame: "What if [limitation] wasn't a problem?"
- **Roundup articles:** ThinkDone listed at natural position. CTA after the ThinkDone entry and at article end.
- **Methodology guides:** CTA after the "Implementation" section. Frame: "ThinkDone automates the [hardest part of methodology]."
- **Problem articles:** CTA as the solution. Frame: "ThinkDone was built for exactly this problem."
- **Comparison articles:** CTA in the "verdict" section. Fair comparison, then: "Try both and decide."
- **Thought leadership:** Light CTA at end only. Let the ideas sell.

---

## Part 12: SEO & Distribution Strategy

### On-Page SEO

- Every article has: title tag, meta description, H1, H2 hierarchy, alt text on images
- Internal linking: every article links to 3-5 related articles (build a web)
- Schema markup: Article, FAQ, HowTo, Review, Product schemas as appropriate
- Target featured snippets with definition boxes and step lists
- Include a table of contents for articles over 2,000 words

### Technical SEO

- Blog at `think-done.com/blog/` (subfolder, not subdomain)
- Category pages: `/blog/reviews/`, `/blog/comparisons/`, `/blog/guides/`, `/blog/essays/`
- Author pages with bio and article list for each persona
- XML sitemap auto-generation
- Canonical URLs for all pages
- Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags
- Fast page load (target <2s LCP)

### Distribution Channels

| Channel | Strategy |
|---------|----------|
| **Organic search** | Primary channel. All content optimized for specific keyword clusters. |
| **Reddit** | Share genuinely helpful guides to r/productivity, r/gtd, r/todoist, r/notion, r/ADHD. Never spam. Add value first. |
| **Hacker News** | Thought leadership essays (T1, T2, T7, T8). Technical deep-dives (Taskwarrior, Org-mode, Linear). |
| **Twitter/X** | Thread versions of key articles. Hot takes from each persona. Screenshot comparisons. |
| **YouTube** | Video versions of top roundups and comparisons by Kai persona. Screen recordings of ThinkDone morning meeting. |
| **Newsletter** | Weekly digest: "This Week in Productivity" — curated articles, app news, one ThinkDone tip. |
| **ProductHunt** | Launch ThinkDone on ProductHunt. Time with Phase 1 content to have a library ready. |
| **Podcasts** | Pitch Professor Whitfield for productivity podcast guest spots. |

### Link Building

- **Roundup inclusion:** Submit ThinkDone to existing "best productivity apps" roundups.
- **Founder story:** Pitch Rachel Torres (or real founder) for startup media interviews.
- **Original research:** Survey productivity app users. Publish results. Earn backlinks from media coverage.
- **Tool integrations:** Get listed on integration partner pages (Zapier, Make, etc.).

## Part 14: Screenshot & Visual Strategy

### Hero Image Art Style: Zen Ink Sketch with Impressionist Watercolor

Minimalist pen/ink line drawings with sparse, low-fidelity watercolor dabs for color. The look is zen-like and meditative — more suggestion than detail. Think Japanese sumi-e meets loose impressionist watercolor. The restraint matches ThinkDone's minimalist productivity philosophy.

**Characteristics:**
- **Line work:** Fine black or dark brown pen strokes, confident but not rigid. Sketch-like, not polished. Visible imperfection is the point.
- **Color:** Sparse watercolor washes — one or two accent colors per image, never fully saturated. Colors bleed softly at edges. Large areas of white/cream space.
- **Palette:** Warm earth tones from the ThinkDone brand — amber (#b8860b), saddle brown (#8b4513), sage green (#5a9a70), forest (#3a6b4e). Occasional muted blue or purple as accent. Background = warm cream/off-white (#f4efe6).
- **Composition:** Generous negative space. Subject off-center. The image should breathe. No busy backgrounds.
- **Fidelity:** Low. Impressionistic. Shapes are suggested, not rendered. A notebook is a few lines and a wash of amber. A person is a gesture, not a portrait.
- **Mood:** Calm, contemplative, slightly melancholy (for problem articles) or quietly confident (for solution articles). Never loud, never corporate.
- **Avoid:** Photorealism, clip art, stock photo aesthetic, busy compositions, neon colors, anything that looks "AI-generated" (symmetrical, over-detailed, plastic).

**Reference:** Chad's watercolor work on bahai-education.org and oceanlibrary.com/blog. Japanese sumi-e ink wash painting. Agnes Martin's minimalist drawings. Loose urban sketching with watercolor accent.

**gpt-image-1 Prompt Template:**
```
Minimalist zen ink sketch with sparse impressionist watercolor accents.
Fine pen line drawing of [SUBJECT], loose and sketch-like, not polished.
One or two watercolor washes in [warm amber / sage green / muted brown],
bleeding softly at edges. Large areas of white/cream negative space.
Off-center composition. Low fidelity, impressionistic — shapes suggested,
not rendered. Warm cream background. Calm, meditative mood.
No photorealism, no busy detail.
Aspect ratio: 7:3, 1400x600px.
```

### Screenshot Requirements

Every product deep-dive needs:
- **Hero screenshot:** The app's main/signature view (full-screen, high-res)
- **Feature screenshots:** 3-5 annotated screenshots showing key features
- **Mobile screenshot:** If the app has a mobile version
- **Historical screenshot:** If available, an early version of the app (Internet Archive/Wayback Machine)

### Screenshot Sources (Legitimate)
- Official app websites and press kits
- App Store / Google Play screenshots (public)
- Internet Archive / Wayback Machine for historical versions
- Our own accounts (create trial accounts for each app)
- Attribute every screenshot: "Source: [App Name] official website" or "Screenshot by ThinkDone editorial team"

### Custom Graphics
- Comparison tables as designed graphics (not just HTML tables)
- Feature comparison infographics
- Methodology diagrams (GTD flowchart, Eisenhower matrix, etc.)
- Timeline graphics for app histories
- Author headshots for persona bylines (AI-generated or stock, clearly disclosed if AI)

---

## Part 15: Content Quality Standards

### Every Article Must:

1. **Cite sources.** Every factual claim needs a source. Founding dates, user counts, pricing, quotes — all cited with links.
2. **Be genuinely useful.** If someone reads only this article and never visits ThinkDone, they should still feel their time was well spent.
3. **Be honest.** Never misrepresent a competitor. Never cherry-pick negative reviews. If an app is genuinely great at something, say so enthusiastically.
4. **Use past tense for the era, not the app.** "Todoist pioneered natural language task entry" — respecting that the era of manual-only planning is ending, not that Todoist is dead. Apps that are actually discontinued (Wunderlist) use clear past tense about the product.
5. **Be transparent about our bias.** Every article should disclose: "ThinkDone is our product. We've tried to be fair and cite our sources. If you think we missed something, let us know."
6. **Include a date and "last updated" stamp.** Pricing and features change. Keep articles current.
7. **Never use AI-generated filler.** No "in today's fast-paced world" or "as we navigate the digital landscape." Write like a human or don't publish.

### Tone Guidelines

- **Respectful of competitors:** These tools were built by passionate people solving real problems. Honor that.
- **Confident, not aggressive:** We believe ThinkDone is genuinely different. We don't need to tear others down.
- **Past tense for the paradigm, not the product:** "Task managers asked users to do their own strategic planning" — the era is ending, not the apps.
- **Conversational but substantive:** Each persona has a distinct voice. None of them are corporate.

5. Find angles competitors haven't covered

Key competitors in the content space:
